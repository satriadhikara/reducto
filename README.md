# Reducto

**Reducto** is a high-performance, distributed build cache designed to **cut CI build times by 30â€“80%** through deterministic, content-addressable artifact storage and cross-job/branch reuse.

> Think of it as a *language-agnostic, S3-backed, build artifact cache* with adapters for your favorite tools and CI systems.

## ðŸš€ Goals

- **Speed up builds** by reusing outputs across jobs, branches, and CI runs.
- **Be language/tool agnostic** via adapters for Node, Rust, Docker, Java, Python, Go, and more.
- **Integrate easily** with GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins, and other CI platforms.
- **Be cloud-portable** â€” works with S3, MinIO, GCS, Azure Blob, or local disk.

## ðŸ”‘ Core Concepts

- **Cache Key** â€” Deterministic hash of all build inputs:  
  `SHA256(build_tool_version, os/arch, env_matrix, dependency_lock, source_fingerprints, build_flags, secrets_salt)`
- **Artifact Manifest** â€” JSON metadata describing produced files, digests, sizes, and related tool metadata.
- **CAS Objects** â€” Stored by digest (SHA256), optionally zstd-compressed and split into 4â€“32 MiB chunks for resumable I/O.

## ðŸ“Œ Status

**Early development** â€” no code yet.
